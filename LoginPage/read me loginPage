I know there is a lot of designs and projects that could potentially look like this or that is very similiar. Although I tried to keep my project as unique as possible I still took inspirations from other which is not 
bad because I think we all can learn from each others ideas. But I did not "copy" my project from another youtube video or github for that matter. Please enjoy it and feel free to take it to use it for your own projects!.


I will upload this to my youtube channel which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvRgYrsFJmQ80Bmnb2e7-ZQ
